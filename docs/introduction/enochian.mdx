description: 'A way to program LLMs in a more ergonomic fashion'

Enochian is a javascript library for ergonomic programming of LLM workflows. It alows you to write use javascript control flow, to "program" the prompts being submitted to an LLM.

By just using the OpenAI NodeJS SDK, you'd have verbose code littered throughout your codebase without any way to manage the *state* of your workflow:

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

async function main() {
  const chatCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  });
}

main();
```

This is fine for one-off requests to the API, but for anything more complicated, it becomse a mess to manage, especially when it comes to more agentic workflows. This is where enochian-js shines. It handles managing the state of your program for you, allowing you to program your LLM with regular javascript control-flow.

```typescript
const s = new ProgramState(new OpenAIBackend({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY }));
s.setModel({ modelName: 'gpt-4o-mini' });
await s
    .add(s.system`You are a helpful assistant.`)
    .add(s.user`Tell me a joke.`)
    .add(s.assistant`${s.gen('joke')}`);
console.log(s.get('joke'));
```

A simple programming model and helpful abstractions allow for a much more ergonomic way to develop applications that use LLMs.
